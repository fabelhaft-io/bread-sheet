# Infrastructure & Deployment

Covers local development setup, the cloud infrastructure (AWS — ECS Fargate), and the push-based CD
pipeline.

---

## Local Development

Docker Compose orchestrates the local environment to mirror production as closely as possible.

```sh
# Start DB + LocalStack (default profile)
docker compose up -d

# Start DB + LocalStack + server (app-dev profile)
docker compose --profile app-dev up -d
```

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| PostgreSQL 18-Alpine | 5432 | Primary database (`admin:password@localhost:5432/breadsheet`) |
| LocalStack | 4566 | AWS service emulation (S3, Lambda, IAM, STS, SQS) |
| Server (app-dev profile) | 3000 | API server with hot-reload via nodemon |

LocalStack allows developers to test S3 uploads and Lambda triggers without an AWS account or cost.

The server reaches LocalStack at `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localstack:4566` and must run with `S3_MODE=localstack` (set in `docker-compose.yml`): LocalStack requires path-style S3 addressing because virtual-hosted-style hostnames like `breadsheet-images-local.localstack` don't resolve inside the Docker network. Production uses `S3_MODE=aws` (SDK-default virtual-hosted addressing).

Image URLs returned to clients are assembled from `ASSET_BASE_URL` (in `server/.env`), which must point at a **device-reachable** address — locally that is `http://<host-LAN-ip>:4566/breadsheet-images-local` (LocalStack's port 4566 is published on the host). See `docs/architecture/backend.md` § Image Processing.

**Local image pipeline (LocalStack init hook):**
`scripts/localstack-init.sh` runs on LocalStack startup (`/etc/localstack/init/ready.d/`) and provisions the full local pipeline — the S3 bucket, the `image-resizer` Lambda, and the `s3:ObjectCreated:*` (prefix `raw/`) trigger — mirroring production without requiring a local Terraform install. The Lambda bundle is mounted into the container from `server/lambda/imageResizer/dist/bundle/`, so it must be built first:

```sh
cd server/lambda/imageResizer
npm install
npm run build   # outputs dist/bundle/ (JS + sharp Linux x64 binary)
cd ../..
docker compose up -d   # init hook deploys the Lambda; re-run after rebuilds via
                       # docker compose restart localstack
```

If the bundle is missing the init script logs a warning and skips the Lambda — uploads still work, but `processed/` objects are never written.

---

## Cloud Infrastructure (AWS — ECS Fargate)

The dev cloud environment is a **Fargate stack fully owned by Terraform** (`terraform/`). All
resources were hand-built first (for learning), then imported into state with zero drift —
`terraform plan` reports no changes. The build log and import map are in
[`fargate-handbuild.md`](fargate-handbuild.md).

### Architecture (dev)

Public hostname **`https://server.dev.bread-sheet.com`** → ALB → Fargate task → RDS. The security-group
chain enforces `internet → ALB → task(:3000) → RDS(:5432)`, each internal hop referencing the previous
group's SG id (no CIDRs).

| Component | Resource | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Network | VPC `10.0.0.0/16`, 2 public + 2 private subnets, **no NAT** | Task runs in the **public** subnets with a public IP (pulls the GHCR image and reaches Supabase / GCP / SSM via the IGW); RDS is private-only. ~$33/mo saved vs NAT. |
| Ingress | Application Load Balancer + ACM cert + Route 53 alias | HTTPS `:443` (cert for `server.dev.bread-sheet.com`) → IP target group (`:3000`, health `GET /`); HTTP `:80` → 301. |
| Compute | ECS **Fargate** service `breadsheet-dev-server-service` on cluster `breadsheet-server-dev` | Desired 1, `256`/`512`, **X86_64** (image is `linux/amd64`), `assignPublicIp=ENABLED`, rolling deploy + circuit-breaker rollback, 120 s health-check grace (migrations run before serving). |
| Database | RDS PostgreSQL `db.t4g.micro`, single-AZ, private, encrypted | Reachable only from the task SG on `5432`. Keyless RDS IAM auth (`DB_AUTH=iam`) via `@aws-sdk/rds-signer` — see [ADR 0002](../architecture-decision-records/0002-rds-database-credentials.md). |
| Images | S3 bucket `breadsheet-dev-s3-…` | `raw/*` private (task `s3:PutObject` only), `processed/*` scoped public-read; resize Lambda deferred. |
| Image registry | GHCR `ghcr.io/fabelhaft-io/bread-sheet-server` (public) | **Not ECR** — the execution role needs no pull secret. |
| Secrets | SSM Parameter Store `/breadsheet/dev/*` | `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY`; injected into the container via the task-def `secrets` block by the **execution** role. `DATABASE_URL` is no longer a secret (keyless IAM auth — no password). |
| Identity | IAM execution + task + deployer roles, GitHub OIDC provider | All keyless. Task role = the app's identity (S3, `rds-db:connect`, + the principal GCP WIF federates). Deployer assumed by CI via OIDC. |
| Keyless GCP | WIF pool `breadsheet-dev` + **AWS provider** + SA `breadsheet-dev-vision` | See § Keyless Google Cloud. |

**Container image.** Published to the free **GitHub Container Registry**
(`ghcr.io/fabelhaft-io/bread-sheet-server`, public) by `.github/workflows/build-image.yml` on push to
`main` — never ECR. The task definition pins the immutable `:<git-sha>` tag.

### Database Authentication — Keyless RDS IAM Auth

The app authenticates to RDS without a stored password. The mechanism:

- **Runtime queries:** `configs/databaseConfig.ts` (when `DB_AUTH=iam`) creates an `@aws-sdk/rds-signer`
  `Signer` and returns an async `password` callback. The `pg.Pool` invokes it on each new physical
  connection — minting a 15-min IAM auth token (local signing, no network round-trip).
- **Migrations:** the Prisma migration engine reads `DATABASE_URL` directly and cannot use the pg.Pool
  callback. The ECS startup script (`scripts/start.sh`) mints a token via `scripts/rds-token.mjs` and
  injects it into `DATABASE_URL` before running `npm run db:deploy`.
- **IAM:** the task role has `rds-db:connect` scoped to the DB instance resource ID + the
  `breadsheet_iam` Postgres user (which has the `rds_iam` grant).
- **TLS:** mandatory for IAM auth. The pg pool verifies the RDS server cert against the CA bundle
  shipped in the Docker image (`certs/rds-global-bundle.pem`, `DB_SSL=verify-full`).

See [ADR 0002](../architecture-decision-records/0002-rds-database-credentials.md) for the full
rationale and migration history.

### Keyless Google Cloud (Vision/Vertex) — Fargate WIF

On Fargate the federation source is the **AWS task role**. The setup: a Workload Identity Pool with an
**AWS provider** (`account_id`, plus an attribute-condition scoping trust to the task role's
assumed-role ARN), a GCP service account `breadsheet-dev-vision` with `roles/aiplatform.user` (Cloud
Vision needs **no** role — API-enablement + an authenticated SA suffices; `roles/cloudvision.user` does
not exist), and a `workloadIdentityUser` binding to the task-role principalSet. At runtime the app
builds a google-auth `AwsClient` with a **programmatic credential supplier**
(`server/src/services/gcpWorkloadIdentity.ts`) that reads AWS credentials from the **ECS container
endpoint** — *not* EC2 IMDS, which doesn't serve task-role credentials on Fargate — and exchanges them
for a short-lived GCP token that impersonates the SA. No key file is mounted. Env:
`GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_AUDIENCE` + `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` (see
[`fargate-handbuild.md`](fargate-handbuild.md) Objective 12).

### Terraform Layout

```
terraform/
  main.tf         # providers (aws + google), data sources
  variables.tf    # all input variables
  locals.tf       # name_prefix, tags
  backend.tf      # S3 remote state, per-env keys
  network.tf      # VPC, subnets, IGW, route tables (no NAT)
  security.tf     # ALB / task / RDS security groups + cross-referencing rules
  rds.tf          # DB subnet group + RDS instance
  iam.tf          # execution / task / deployer roles, policies, GitHub OIDC provider
  s3.tf           # images bucket + public-access-block + ownership + policy + CORS
  ssm.tf          # SSM parameters (Supabase URL + key)
  ecs.tf          # ECS cluster + task definition + service
  alb.tf          # ALB + target group + listeners + ACM cert + validation
  dns.tf          # Route 53 zone (dev.bread-sheet.com) + A-alias → ALB
  gcp-wif.tf      # GCP WIF pool + AWS provider + SA + bindings
  outputs.tf      # Useful references (URLs, ARNs, names)
  environments/
    dev.tfvars           # Variable values for dev
    dev.s3.tfbackend     # Backend config for dev state
```

### Remote State (S3 backend)

State lives in an S3 backend with one key per environment (`<env>/terraform.tfstate`). The
backend is configured partially in `backend.tf`; concrete bucket/key/region come from a
per-environment `*.tfbackend` file at init time. Locking uses the S3-native lock file
(`use_lockfile`, Terraform ≥ 1.10) — no DynamoDB table.

**One-time bootstrap** (the state bucket must exist before the first `init`):

```sh
aws s3 mb s3://breadsheet-tfstate --region us-east-1
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket breadsheet-tfstate \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

### Apply

```sh
# Init selects the backend + downloads modules. Re-run when switching environments.
terraform -chdir=terraform init -backend-config=environments/dev.s3.tfbackend

# Plan (always review before apply)
terraform -chdir=terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars

# Apply
terraform -chdir=terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
```

To validate config without AWS credentials (no apply): `init -backend=false` then `validate`.

### Terraform ↔ CD Ownership Split

CD (GitHub Actions) registers new task-definition revisions on every push — outside Terraform. To
prevent drift fights:

- `aws_ecs_service.server` has `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [task_definition] }` — Terraform owns the
  service; CD owns which revision it runs.
- `aws_ecs_task_definition.server` has `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [container_definitions] }` —
  Terraform owns the structure; CD updates the image tag.

### S3 Bucket Layout

```
s3://breadsheet-dev-s3-…/
├── raw/
│   ├── product/{uuid}.jpg    # Uploaded by API; triggers resize Lambda (deferred)
│   └── label/{uuid}.jpg      # OCR fallback images
└── processed/
    └── {uuid}.jpg            # Final display images (resize Lambda output)
```

### Pausing / Resuming the Dev Stack

Dev has no NAT gateway (~$33/mo already avoided). The remaining always-on costs are the Fargate
task (~$9/mo), RDS `db.t4g.micro` (~$12/mo), and the ALB (~$16–18/mo **flat**, regardless of
traffic — an ALB has no "stopped" state, only exists-or-doesn't). Two tiers, by how much of that
you want to shed.

**Tier 1 — CLI only, no Terraform changes (sheds the Fargate task + RDS compute):**

```sh
# Pause
aws ecs update-service --cluster breadsheet-server-dev --service breadsheet-dev-server-service --desired-count 0
aws rds stop-db-instance --db-instance-identifier breadsheet-dev-database-1

# Resume
aws rds start-db-instance --db-instance-identifier breadsheet-dev-database-1
aws ecs update-service --cluster breadsheet-server-dev --service breadsheet-dev-server-service --desired-count 1

# Check state
aws ecs describe-services --cluster breadsheet-server-dev --services breadsheet-dev-server-service \
  --query 'services[0].{desired:desiredCount,running:runningCount,pending:pendingCount}' --output table
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier breadsheet-dev-database-1 \
  --query 'DBInstances[0].DBInstanceStatus' --output text
```

Paused looks like `running:0` (ECS) and RDS status `stopping` → `stopped`. Resumed looks like
`running:1` and RDS status `available`.

Caveats:
- RDS auto-restarts itself after **7 days** stopped (AWS-enforced) — re-run `stop-db-instance` if
  the pause runs longer. For a pause of a month or more, use Tier 3 instead: there is no "stop for
  30 days" API, and a stopped instance still bills for its 20 GB of gp3.
- `aws_ecs_service.server` (`ecs.tf`) hardcodes `desired_count = 1`, and its
  `lifecycle.ignore_changes` only covers `task_definition`. Any `terraform apply` while paused —
  even for something unrelated — will see the drift and silently scale the service back to 1. Avoid
  `apply`ing while paused, or add `desired_count` to `ignore_changes` if pause/resume becomes
  routine.

**Tier 2 — also tear down the ALB (sheds the flat ~$16–18/mo charge too):**

```sh
# Pause (review first, then destroy)
terraform -chdir=terraform plan -destroy -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -target=aws_lb.main
terraform -chdir=terraform destroy -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -target=aws_lb.main

# Resume
terraform -chdir=terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars
# then re-run the Tier 1 resume commands (RDS + ECS) — no point paying for compute with no ALB in front of it

# Check state
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --names breadsheet-dev-alb   # "LoadBalancerNotFoundException" while paused
terraform -chdir=terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars   # "No changes" once fully resumed
```

`-target=aws_lb.main` on a destroy automatically cascades to everything that *depends on* the ALB —
`aws_lb_listener.https`, `aws_lb_listener.http_redirect`, and `aws_route53_record.server` — since
they'd otherwise reference a deleted resource. The target group, the ACM cert (+ validation), the
Route 53 zone, and the ECS service sit outside that dependency chain and are untouched, so the cert
stays `Issued` and nothing needs re-validating on resume — `apply` just recreates the ALB, listeners,
and alias record pointing at the new ALB's DNS name.

**Tier 3 — snapshot and delete RDS (long pauses; sheds DB storage too):**

For a pause of a month or more, stopping is the wrong tool: AWS force-restarts a stopped instance
after 7 days, and stopped or not you keep paying for the 20 GB gp3 volume and Performance Insights.
Deleting the instance leaves only manual-snapshot storage, billed on *used* data — cents for a dev
DB. Do Tier 2 first (the ALB is the bigger line item), then:

```sh
# ── Pause ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 1. Manual snapshot. Manual (not automated) matters: automated backups are deleted with
#    the instance, manual snapshots outlive it and are not managed by Terraform.
aws rds create-db-snapshot --region eu-west-1 \
  --db-instance-identifier breadsheet-dev-database-1 \
  --db-snapshot-identifier breadsheet-dev-pause-$(date +%F)
aws rds wait db-snapshot-completed --region eu-west-1 \
  --db-snapshot-identifier breadsheet-dev-pause-$(date +%F)

# 2. Destroy the instance. `db_skip_final_snapshot = true` (the dev default) is fine — the
#    manual snapshot from step 1 is the copy that matters. Review the plan first.
terraform -chdir=terraform plan -destroy -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -target=aws_db_instance.main
terraform -chdir=terraform destroy -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -target=aws_db_instance.main

# ── Resume ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 3. Find the snapshot (the filter still works after the source instance is gone).
aws rds describe-db-snapshots --region eu-west-1 \
  --db-instance-identifier breadsheet-dev-database-1 --snapshot-type manual \
  --query 'sort_by(DBSnapshots,&SnapshotCreateTime)[-1].DBSnapshotIdentifier' --output text

# 4. BEFORE applying: check the image pin in ecs.tf against the revision that was live when
#    you paused. Terraform's task definition is created from ecs.tf, not from CI's latest
#    revision — see "the image pin drifts" below. Note the tag from the pre-pause service:
aws ecs describe-task-definition --region eu-west-1 --task-definition breadsheet-dev-server \
  --query 'taskDefinition.containerDefinitions[0].image' --output text

# 5. Recreate everything from the snapshot. Restores the DB, then the ALB and the three
#    cascade resources below — one apply, no manual reconnection.
terraform -chdir=terraform apply -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars \
  -var db_snapshot_identifier=breadsheet-dev-pause-YYYY-MM-DD

# 6. Verify, then delete the snapshot to stop paying for it.
aws rds describe-db-instances --region eu-west-1 --db-instance-identifier breadsheet-dev-database-1 \
  --query 'DBInstances[0].{status:DBInstanceStatus,endpoint:Endpoint.Address}' --output table
terraform -chdir=terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars    # "No changes" once fully resumed
aws rds delete-db-snapshot --region eu-west-1 --db-snapshot-identifier breadsheet-dev-pause-YYYY-MM-DD
```

`db_snapshot_identifier` (`variables.tf`, default `""`) feeds `aws_db_instance.main.snapshot_identifier`.
Pass it **only on the resuming apply** — it is consumed at create time and is in the resource's
`lifecycle.ignore_changes`, so leaving it out of later applies is correct and will not plan a
replacement. Adding it to `dev.tfvars` instead would be a standing hazard: any future recreate would
silently restore month-old data.

What the destroy cascades to, and why that is the point:

| Resource | Why it's dragged in | On resume |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aws_ecs_service.server` | depends on the task definition | recreated at `desired_count = 1` |
| `aws_ecs_task_definition.server` | `ecs.tf` interpolates `aws_db_instance.main.address` into `DB_HOST` / `DATABASE_URL` | re-rendered against the restored endpoint |
| `aws_iam_role_policy.ecs_task_rds_iam` | `iam.tf` scopes `rds-db:connect` to `aws_db_instance.main.resource_id` | re-scoped to the new resource ID |

**The image pin drifts — check it before every resume.** `aws_ecs_task_definition.server` has
`lifecycle.ignore_changes = [container_definitions]`, so the revisions CI push-deploys are never
reconciled into state: Terraform's copy stays frozen at whatever it last created, while the live
service moves on. That is harmless during normal operation (Terraform never touches the running
task definition) but decisive here, because the resume *creates* a task definition — from
`ecs.tf`, not from the live revision. Whatever `ecs.tf:42` pins is what the stack comes back on.
This was already wrong once: the pin was a SHA that is neither a commit in the repo nor a tag in
GHCR, so a resume would have failed on `CannotPullContainerError` and tripped the deployment
circuit breaker — *after* the DB restore, making a healthy snapshot look like the culprit. Confirm
the tag resolves before applying:

```sh
TOKEN=$(curl -s "https://ghcr.io/token?scope=repository:fabelhaft-io/bread-sheet-server:pull&service=ghcr.io" | jq -r .token)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json' \
  https://ghcr.io/v2/fabelhaft-io/bread-sheet-server/manifests/<sha>   # want 200, not 404
```

A restored instance gets a **new `resource_id`** (`db-XXXX…`) even when the identifier and endpoint
hostname are unchanged. Since the IAM policy interpolates it, `apply` fixes it for free — but a
restore done by hand in the console would leave the old ID in place and IAM auth would fail with a
`PAM authentication` error that looks nothing like a permissions problem. Restore through Terraform.

Two more notes on the restore:
- Reusing the same `identifier` in the same account+region normally yields the **same endpoint
  hostname**, but nothing depends on that: `DB_HOST` is interpolated, not hardcoded. Confirm with the
  `describe-db-instances` query in step 5 rather than assuming.
- `db_name`, `username` and the master password come from the snapshot; RDS ignores those arguments
  on a restore. The `breadsheet_iam` user and its `rds_iam` grant live *inside* the database, so they
  come back with it — no re-grant needed. `aws_ecs_task_definition.server` has
  `ignore_changes = [container_definitions]`, which is irrelevant here: the task definition is
  destroyed and recreated, and ignore_changes does not apply to creation.

## Deployment Pipeline (push-based CD to ECS)

ECS is **push-deployed** — CI calls the ECS API to roll the service. There is no ArgoCD pull loop.
Keyless throughout: GitHub Actions assumes an AWS IAM **deployer role** via OIDC, no stored AWS keys.

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

1. **Test** — `npm test` in `server/` and `bread-sheet-app/` (`.github/workflows/test.yml`).
2. **Build & push** — the `build` job in `build-image.yml` builds `server/Dockerfile` and pushes
   `ghcr.io/<owner>/bread-sheet-server` at `:<git-sha>` (immutable) + `:latest`, using the built-in
   `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
3. **Deploy to dev (automatic)** — the `deploy-dev` job (`needs: build`) assumes the deployer role via
   OIDC, **fetches the active task definition**, swaps in the `:<git-sha>` image
   (`amazon-ecs-render-task-definition`), registers a new revision, and `update-service`s the dev
   service, waiting for `services-stable` (`amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition`). Merge to `main` ⇒ dev
   redeploys, no human step.

The task definition is **fetched from AWS, not stored in the repo**, so CD only swaps the image and
never clobbers the env/secrets owned by Terraform.

**Rollback** = re-deploy the previous task-def revision (ECS keeps them); the deployment **circuit
breaker** auto-reverts a failed rollout.

**Prod promotion (deferred — no prod stage yet):** a gated release (git tag / GitHub Release / manual
dispatch + an `environment: production` required reviewer) promoting the **same** already-built
`:<git-sha>` to a prod service. Built when a prod cluster/service exists.

The mobile app has its own, unrelated build pipeline — see **Mobile App Build (Android APK)** below.

### Mobile App Build (Android APK)

`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` is a manually-triggered (`workflow_dispatch`) workflow, separate
from the server's push-based CD above — it does not run on every push. It builds `bread-sheet-app/`
via **EAS Build** (Expo's cloud build service, not a local Gradle build in the runner): the job installs
`eas-cli` (`expo/expo-github-action`), runs `eas build --platform android --profile preview --wait
--json`, then downloads the resulting APK from the build's `artifacts.buildUrl` and uploads it as a
workflow artifact (30-day retention).

Profiles are defined in `bread-sheet-app/eas.json` — `preview` and `development` both set
`distribution: internal` + `android.buildType: apk` (installable `.apk`, not a Play Store `.aab`);
`production` is reserved for a future signed store build.

**One-time setup required before this workflow can run (not done by CI):**
1. `npx eas login` + `npx eas init` from `bread-sheet-app/` — creates the project on expo.dev and
   writes `extra.eas.projectId` into `app.json`. This step is interactive and must be run locally, then
   the resulting `app.json` change committed.
2. Add an `EXPO_TOKEN` repository secret — an access token from
   `expo.dev/accounts/<account>/settings/access-tokens`.

Because the app ships native modules (`expo-camera`, `@react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition`,
`expo-image-manipulator`) it cannot run in vanilla Expo Go — EAS Build compiles a real native binary
per `app.json`'s `plugins`, so this workflow (or an equivalent local `eas build`) is the only way to
get an installable build with those modules working end-to-end.

### Database Migrations — Ride Along

The container command is `sh scripts/start.sh`, which runs `npm run db:deploy` (Prisma migrations)
before `node dist/server.js`. When `DB_AUTH=iam`, the script mints an IAM token into `DATABASE_URL`
first — so the migration engine authenticates with a short-lived token too. Prisma's migration lock
keeps the brief two-task rolling-deploy overlap safe — no separate migration Job is needed.

## Infrastructure as Code Principles

- **All cloud resources defined in `terraform/`** — `terraform plan` shows no drift on the dev
  workspace. The build log and verification in [`fargate-handbuild.md`](fargate-handbuild.md)
  documents the hand-build → import journey.
- Secrets (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY`) live in **SSM Parameter Store** and are
  injected via the task-def `secrets` block — never committed. Database auth is **keyless** (IAM).
  Google Cloud access is **keyless** via Workload Identity Federation.
- Lambda source and configuration will live in `terraform/` alongside other infra (resize Lambda is a
  deferred post-build adaptation).
- The **container registry is external**: the server image lives in GitHub Container Registry, not AWS.

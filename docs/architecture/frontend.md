# Frontend Architecture

React Native / Expo mobile app using **Expo Router** for file-based navigation and **Supabase** for authentication.

## Routing

Expo Router maps the file system to routes. Route groups (folders wrapped in parentheses) are invisible in the URL — they exist only to apply a shared layout.

| Group | Auth required | Layout |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| `(auth)/` | No | Stack navigator, no header |
| `(tabs)/` | Yes | Bottom tab bar |
| `(app)/` | Yes | Stack navigator, no tab bar |
| `(account)/` | Yes | Stack navigator, no tab bar |

New authenticated route groups must be added to the `AUTHENTICATED_GROUPS` constant in `app/_layout.tsx` or the navigation guard will redirect them back to `/(tabs)`.

## Auth Architecture

### Layer diagram

```
lib/supabase.ts                  ← Supabase client (singleton)
       ↓
features/auth/                   ← All auth actions + validation helpers
       ↓
hooks/use-session.tsx            ← Session state + real-time subscription
       ↓
app/_layout.tsx                  ← Navigation guard (redirects based on session)
       ↓
app/(auth)/ + app/(account)/     ← Screens — call features/auth, handle UI only
```

### 1. Supabase Client — `lib/supabase.ts`

Single `supabase` client created from env vars at startup:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY
```

Throws at startup if either var is missing. Only `features/auth/` and `hooks/use-session.tsx` import the client directly — screens never reach for it.

### 2. Auth Feature — `features/auth/`

All Supabase auth calls and shared validation live here. Screens import named functions instead of calling Supabase directly. This keeps route files free of SDK details.

Responsibilities:
- Wrapping every Supabase auth operation (sign in, sign up, guest sign-in, account upgrade, sign out)
- Shared input validation (email format, password rules)

### 3. Session Context — `hooks/use-session.tsx`

`SessionProvider` wraps the app and exposes `{ session, isLoading, isAnonymous }` via React context.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `session` | `Session \| null` | Full Supabase session (includes `session.user`) |
| `isLoading` | `boolean` | `true` until the initial session restore completes |
| `isAnonymous` | `boolean` | `true` when the signed-in user is a guest (no email) |

On mount it:
1. Calls `supabase.auth.getSession()` to restore any persisted session (handles app re-opens)
2. Subscribes to `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()` to react to all future auth events

`isLoading` stays `true` until the initial `getSession()` resolves, preventing premature redirects.

### 4. Navigation Guard — `app/_layout.tsx`

`RootLayoutNav` runs a `useEffect` whenever `session`, `isLoading`, or `segments` changes:

```
isLoading = true                      → render null (splash state)
session + not in authenticated group  → router.replace('/(tabs)')
no session                            → router.replace('/(auth)/login')
```

Post-signup deep-link return: before any auth call that triggers email verification, the calling screen persists the intended destination to `AsyncStorage` under `pendingReturnTo`. On `SIGNED_IN`, the guard reads and clears this key and navigates there instead of `/(tabs)`.

---

## Auth Flows

### Guest

```
features/auth → signInAsGuest()
  → onAuthStateChange fires (SIGNED_IN, is_anonymous = true)
  → guard redirects to /(tabs)
```

### Email / Password Sign In

```
features/auth → signIn(email, password)
  → onAuthStateChange fires
  → guard redirects to /(tabs)
```

### Sign Up

```
features/auth → signUp(email, password)
  → persist pendingReturnTo via lib/pending-return-to (if returnTo param is set)
  → email verification required before session is active
  → screen navigates to post-signup confirmation screen in (auth)/
  → user clicks magic link → app cold-launches
  → onAuthStateChange fires (SIGNED_IN)
  → guard reads pendingReturnTo, clears it, navigates there (or /(tabs) if absent)
```

### Upgrade (guest → registered)

Anonymous users can link an email and password from the Profile tab. The Supabase user ID stays the same — all ratings, submissions, and group memberships are preserved.

```
features/auth → upgradeAccount(email, password)
  → verification email sent
  → on verification: isAnonymous becomes false, profile screen updates
```

### Sign Out

```
features/auth → signOut()
  → onAuthStateChange fires, session becomes null
  → guard redirects to /(auth)/login
```

## State Management

React Context is used for lightweight global state. All context providers are composed in `app/_layout.tsx`:

| Provider | Hook | State |
|----------|------|-------|
| `SessionProvider` | `useSession()` | Auth session, loading state, anonymous flag |
| `RecentProductsProvider` | `useRecentProducts()` | In-memory list of recently viewed product barcodes |

For server data (ratings, products, groups), hooks fetch directly from the API — no global cache layer. Pull-to-refresh is the primary re-fetch mechanism.

---

## Profile & Account Management

The **Profile tab** adapts to the user's account state:

**Guest users** see:
- Avatar with "?" and "Guest account" label
- "Create Account" row → upgrade flow in `(account)/`
- Sign Out (warns about data loss for anonymous accounts)

**Registered users** see:
- Avatar with email initial and email address
- "Change Email" and "Change Password" rows → `(account)/`
- Sign Out

On web, confirmation dialogs use `window.confirm` (Alert.alert buttons are unsupported). On native, `Alert.alert` is used.

---

## Icons

`components/ui/` contains a platform-bridging icon component that maps SF Symbols (iOS) to Material Icons (Android/web). New icons require a mapping entry in that component.

---

## Theme

`useColorScheme` detects system light/dark preference. Colour tokens are in `constants/`. The root layout wraps the app in React Navigation's `ThemeProvider`.

---

## Key Patterns

- **Route files are UI-only.** Business logic belongs in `features/` modules. Screens import from feature modules, handle loading/error state, and navigate — nothing more.
- **Supabase is the single source of truth** for auth state — never manage session tokens manually in app code.
- **`isAnonymous`** from `useSession()` is the canonical way to branch UI between guest and registered users — do not inspect `session.user` directly in screens.
- **Email validation** is centralised in `features/auth/` — do not duplicate in screens.
- **Native-optional modules** used by the product-submission flow (`@react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition`, `expo-image-picker`, `expo-image-manipulator`, `expo-file-system/legacy`) are loaded via guarded `require()` inside `features/products/`. This keeps jest-expo tests free of native shims and lets the UI gracefully fall back to manual entry if the runtime bundle doesn't ship the module.

## Product Submission (TICKET-P5-002)

The multi-step Add Product flow is rooted at `app/(app)/add-product.tsx` with all business logic under `features/products/`:

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `constants.ts` | `MIN_OCR_LENGTH`, image size caps, JPEG quality targets — must match the backend contract defined in P5-003 |
| `types.ts` | `ProductSubmission`, `ExtractedLabel`, `ProductDetail` — shared wire types |
| `api.ts` | `submitProduct`, `uploadProductImage`, `extractLabelFromText`, `extractLabelFromImage`, `approveProduct`, `rejectProduct` |
| `ocr.ts` | `recogniseLabelText` — thin wrapper over `@react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition`, returns `{rawText, unavailable}` |
| `image-picker.ts` | `captureImage` — camera or library, returns the raw URI |
| `image-processing.ts` | `processCaptureForUpload` — runs `expo-image-manipulator` to resize/recompress, enforces the 5 MB client cap via `ImageTooLargeError` |
| `extract.ts` | `extractFromLabelImage` — orchestrates OCR-then-backend: text path when OCR text ≥ `MIN_OCR_LENGTH`, image fallback otherwise, never throws |

### Reviewer flow

`app/(app)/review-product/[barcode].tsx` is the reviewer screen for peer approval. It's surfaced from the product detail screen via a "Needs review" banner that is shown when:
- the product response carries `unverified: true`
- the caller is registered (not anonymous)
- the caller is not the submitter (`submittedByUserId !== session.user.id`)

The reviewer screen renders every submitted field — including `null` values, shown as "Not provided" — so the reviewer can judge completeness. "Looks correct" calls `POST /api/products/:barcode/verify`; "Something looks wrong" calls `DELETE /api/products/:barcode/verify` (reused as the "no" vote channel).
